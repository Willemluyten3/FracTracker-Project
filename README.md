# FracTracker Image Map Project
Image mapping project for FracTracker Alliance

## Project Overview

The FracTracker Image Map project aims to provide an interactive visualization of the media assets stored in the FracTracker Alliance Flickr account. This project involves scraping the FracTracker Alliance Flickr account, transforming the data into an attribute table, cleaning and organizing the information, and then utilizing it to create a dynamic map using ArcGIS Online. The resulting map, named "FracTracker Image Map," offers a interface to explore and visualize images related to oil and gas activities their impacts on surrounding and communities.


## Data Collection

The project begins with the scraping of the FracTracker Alliance Flickr account to gather metadata and URLs of images related to their activities. The data collected include attributes such as image titles, descriptions, dates, and geolocation information where available.

The collected data is then transformed into an attribute table, allowing for easy organization and manipulation. This step involves parsing and structuring the scraped data into a format suitable for map creation. During this phase, efforts were made to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

## Map Creation

Utilizing the power of ArcGIS Online, the transformed data is employed to create an interactive map that displays the images on a geographical interface. The map provides users with the ability to visualize the projects The FracTracker Alliance has been involved with 

## Accessing the Map

The "FracTracker Image Map", published by the ArcGIS account "willemluyten" is publicly accessible on ArcGIS Online.
